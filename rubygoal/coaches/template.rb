# RubyGoal - Football for Rubyists
#
# This document contains several minimal implementations for a Rubygoal coach.
#
# This class must implement at least the methods `name` and `formation(match)`
# This class must be implemented within Rubygoal module.

    # This method must return a hash with:
    # - captain: An array with one elment, the captains name
    # - fast: An array of 3 elements with the fast players' names
    # - average: An array of 6 elements with the average players' names
    # If not set, it will be inherited from Coach class, having player names
    # set by default as: :captain, :fast1..3 and :average1..6
